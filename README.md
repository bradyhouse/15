# 15
"15" stands for Puzzle 15, which is a game inspired by the classic "Fifteen Puzzle" game. It has 3 levels corresponding to 8 (3x3), 14 (4x4), or 24 (5x5) block grid. In order to complete (or win) a level, simply put the squares in sequential order. In order to achieve a high score, do it in fewer moves than anyone else. The basic logic of the game was initially written in straight JavaScript (See codepen above). This POC was then used as basis of my first NativeScript app (aka "hello world"). My Hello World is now available for free in the App Store and on Google Play.
