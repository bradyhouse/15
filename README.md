"15" stands for Puzzle 15, which is a game inspired by the classic "Fifteen Puzzle" game. It has 3 levels corresponding to 8 (3x3), 14 (4x4), or 24 (5x5) block grid. In order to complete (or win) a level, simply put the squares in sequential order. In order to achieve a high score, do it in fewer moves than anyone else. The compiled version of this application is now available for free in the App Store and on Google Play.
